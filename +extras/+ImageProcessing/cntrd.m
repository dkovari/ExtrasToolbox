function out=cntrd(im,mx,sz)
% out=cntrd(im,mx,sz)
% 
% PURPOSE:  calculates the centroid of bright spots to sub-pixel accuracy.
%  Inspired by Grier & Crocker's feature for IDL, but greatly simplified and optimized
%  for matlab
% 
% INPUT:
% im: image to process, particle should be bright spots on dark background with little noise
%   ofen an bandpass filtered brightfield image or a nice fluorescent image
%
% mx: locations of local maxima to pixel-level accuracy from pkfnd.m
%
% sz: diamter of the window over which to average to calculate the centroid.  
%     should be big enough
%     to capture the whole particle but not so big that it captures others.  
%     if initial guess of center (from pkfnd) is far from the centroid, the
%     window will need to be larger than the particle size.  RECCOMMENDED
%     size is the long lengthscale used in bpass plus 2.
%     
%
% NOTE:
%  - if pkfnd, and cntrd return more then one location per particle then
%  you should try to filter your input more carefully.  If you still get
%  more than one peak for particle, use the optional sz parameter in pkfnd
%  - If you want sub-pixel accuracy, you need to have a lot of pixels in your window (sz>>1). 
%    To check for pixel bias, plot a histogram of the fractional parts of the resulting locations
%  - It is HIGHLY recommended to run in interactive mode to adjust the parameters before you
%    analyze a bunch of images.
%
% OUTPUT:  a N x 4 array containing, x, y and brightness for each feature
%           out(:,1) is the x-coordinates
%           out(:,2) is the y-coordinates
%           out(:,3) is the brightnesses
%           out(:,4) is the square of the radius of gyration
%           out(:,5) = Eccentricity
%           out(:,6) = angle of major axis

% CREATED: Eric R. Dufresne, Yale University, Feb 4 2005
%  5/2005 inputs diamter instead of radius
%  Modifications:
%  D.B. (6/05) Added code from imdist/dist to make this stand alone.
%  ERD (6/05) Increased frame of reject locations around edge to 1.5*sz
%  ERD 6/2005  By popular demand, 1. altered input to be formatted in x,y
%  space instead of row, column space  2. added forth column of output,
%  rg^2
%  ERD 8/05  Outputs had been shifted by [0.5,0.5] pixels.  No more!
%  ERD 8/24/05  Woops!  That last one was a red herring.  The real problem
%  is the "ringing" from the output of bpass.  I fixed bpass (see note),
%  and no longer need this kludge.  Also, made it quite nice if mx=[];
%  ERD 6/06  Added size and brightness output ot interactive mode.  Also 
%   fixed bug in calculation of rg^2
%  JWM 6/07  Small corrections to documentation
%  Dan Kovari, Curtis Lab, Ga Tech 11/2014
%   Cleaned up some of the syntax to be in compliance with matlabs best
%   coding practices, this should also help with speed.  Simplified some of
%   the code, and fixed the 1 pixel offset that was being introduced. Got
%   rid of interactive flag. Still need to re-implement eccentricity, overload
%  Dan Kovari, Emory Univ. 02/09/2019
%   Added Image moment calculations to get eccentricity and angle
