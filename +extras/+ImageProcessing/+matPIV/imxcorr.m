function [dXY,SNR,C]=imxcorr(im1,im2)
% Compute cross-correlation of two images, and return the approximate
% displacement calculated by looking at the shift in peak correlation
% signal.
% Inputs:
%   im1 starting image
%   im2 ending image
% Outputs:
%   dXY, shift in image [x,y] from im1 -> im2
%   SNR     ratio of value of largest peak to second largest peak, or average
%           value of C if no other peaks are detected
%   C   The results of the cross-correlation


% For small windows non-fft based xcorr2 is probably faster.
% O(fft) ~= 12Nlog2(2N)+8N+4
% O(full) ~= 2N^2
% The intersection of the two is N~42.5
