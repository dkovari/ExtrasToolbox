      <div class="helptext"><pre><!--helptext -->  <span class="helptopic">handle</span>   Superclass of all handle classes.
    A handle is an object that indirectly references its data.  When a
    handle is constructed, an object with storage for property values is
    created.  The constructor returns a handle to this object.  When a
    handle object is copied, for example during assignment or when passed
    to a MATLAB function, the handle is copied but not the underlying
    object property values.
 
    The <span class="helptopic">handle</span> class is an abstract class and cannot be directly
    constructed.  It is the superclass for all classes that follow handle
    semantics.
 
    Classes that define events must be handle classes (i.e., they must be
    derived from <span class="helptopic">handle</span>).  Classes that are derived from the built-in 
    classes matlab.mixin.SetGet or dynamicprops become handle classes.  
    When defining a class that inherits from two or more super-classes ,  
    simultaneously all superclasses must be handle classes or none can be.   
    A derived class cannot inherit from both handle and value classes 
    simultaneously.
 
    Classes that are derived from <span class="helptopic">handle</span> inherit no properties, but do 
    inherit the following methods which can be overridden as needed.
 
  handle methods:
    <a href="matlab:helpwin handle/addlistener">addlistener</a>  - Add listener for event and bind to source.
    <a href="matlab:helpwin handle/delete">delete</a>       - Delete a handle object.
    <a href="matlab:helpwin handle/eq">eq</a>           - Test handle equality.
    <a href="matlab:helpwin handle/findobj">findobj</a>      - Find objects with specified property values.
    <a href="matlab:helpwin handle/findprop">findprop</a>     - Find property of MATLAB handle object.
    <a href="matlab:helpwin handle/ge">ge</a>           - Greater than or equal relation.
    <a href="matlab:helpwin handle/gt">gt</a>           - Greater than relation.
    <a href="matlab:helpwin handle/isvalid">isvalid</a>      - Test handle validity.
    <a href="matlab:helpwin handle/le">le</a>           - Less than or equal relation for handles.
    <a href="matlab:helpwin handle/listener">listener</a>     - Add listener for event without binding to source.
    <a href="matlab:helpwin handle/lt">lt</a>           - Less than relation for handles.
    <a href="matlab:helpwin handle/ne">ne</a>           - Not equal relation for handles.
    <a href="matlab:helpwin handle/notify">notify</a>       - Notify listeners of event.</pre></div><!--after help -->
